## Problem 1: Logistic Regression: Experiment

Based on the experiments conducted, it is clear to see that as you increase the number of samples into the Logistic Regression classifier, the higher the test accuracy. This seems logical as the patterns which make up the dataset are more representative with a higher number of samples. The more samples there are, the better the model can generalize.

Below you can find the test accuracy of the model as a function of the number of samples used while training. There is a clear upward trend as we include more and more samples.
